 * @author 2030 student [add your name and student number here]
 *
 * The class should implement a product that could be sold in a store
 * The class is intended to be used in the implementation of another class or classes
 * 
 * ONE public constructor should exist:
 * Product(String name, double price): creates a product with the specified name and price
 * (you may add other - non-public - constructors, if you desire) 
 * 
 * in addition to the above, the following public methods should be implemented:
 * public String getName()
 * public double getPrice()
 * public void setPrice(double price)
 * 
 * String toString()
 * this one should return a String in the form of "name, price=X" where X is the item price, with two decimal digits (no quotation marks)
 * 
 * IMPORTANT
 * You are expected to use the best practices you learned in EECS 2030 so far.
 * you may import any standard library classes, as necessary
 * e.g., import java.util.List;
 *
