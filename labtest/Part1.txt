Short-answer Questions (4 questions, 2 points each)

Q9.	(2 points) What would happen if the methods equals() and hashCode() in Java are not consistent with one another?
Explain in one or two sentences.

Q9 Answer: Two objects when equals() return false may return the same hashCode() will cause search in hashmap slowly; or two objection with same equals() return different hashCode() which is not allowed in hash.


Q10.	(2 points) A hashCode method is implemented the following way:
	public int hashCode() {
		return 0;
	}
Is such an implementation correct (e.g., will the methods relying on it still work correctly)? 
If so, how well will such an implementation perform in places where it is used (one or two sentences)?

Q10 Answer: It's a correct implementation. For a well case example, all the Objects in this Class are the same and equals, so they return the same hashCode 0.


Q11.	(2 points) The objects of some class are not Comparable. Can a bunch of such objects be used in a data structure like a
TreeMap? Motivate your answer in one or two sentences.

Q11 Answer:  No, all keys inserted into the TreeMap must implement the Comparable interface. Furthermore, all such keys must be mutually comparable.


Q12.	(2 points) What is the difference between static factory methods and constructors? Explain in one or two sentences.

Q12 Answer: A constructor is used to construct an object in public or this private class. While, static factory methods are used to set a object will/had been constructed by a constructor, as it may be likely to yield significantly better space and time performance.
